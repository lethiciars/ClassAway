# ClassAway

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

## Motivation
Ever find yourself googling “Things to do in Singapore” when planning for a day out with your friends or family? Like many others residing in Singapore, we often find ourselves feeling as if there is simply nothing to do. The main tourist sites and popular shopping areas have been so frequently visited that people are constantly seeking new experiences. Despite having a multitude of interesting activities offered by local businesses, such activities are difficult to find through your usual google search. This is usually due to the fact that local businesses often lack the capital to engage in extensive advertising to promote their services. Don’t you wish there was an easier way to find fun activities to do?

## Aim
We hope to make a centralised platform that can match consumer’s interests to available classes/workshops provided by businesses through a mobile application.

## User Stories
Users
As a user interested in learning a new skill/ picking up a new hobby, I want to be able to find the right classes for me according to my current skill level, location and budget.
As a user attending a class alone, I want to be able to find another individual to attend the class with.
As a user planning a fun activity with a group of friends/family, I want to be able to find suitable classes that I can share with them and make group bookings.
As a user who intends to book multiple classes, I want to be able to keep track of all my classes conveniently.


Businesses (e.g. Dance Studios, Pottery Studios, Coffee/Baking workshops, etc) 
As a business who offers workshops and classes, I want to market my business and display available classes to potential customers in a comprehensive way.
As a business who offers multiple classes and workshops, I want to be able to keep track of the number of vacancies and the users attending each session.]
As a business who values customer satisfaction, I want to be able to collect user’s feedback on our classes and workshops.

## Project Scope
ClassAway is a mobile application that allows consumers to find classes or workshops provided by local businesses that match their interests.
